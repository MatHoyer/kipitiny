title: Multiple servers
description: Manage remote Docker hosts over SSH from one manager
order: 10

*Settings → Servers* adds remote Docker hosts over SSH. The manager reaches the
remote Docker **socket** through an SSH channel (pure Go, no `ssh` binary, the
daemon never listens on TCP) with its own ed25519 key, shown in the form to add
to `authorized_keys`. The server's host key is pinned on first connection.
The remote sshd must allow `AllowTcpForwarding yes` (or `local`) and
`AllowStreamLocalForwarding yes` (Debian/Ubuntu defaults; Alpine disables it).

A project lives on one server (its services share a private network); choose it
when creating the project. Each server gets its own Traefik, so point a domain's
DNS at the server running the app. That Traefik reaches the manager at
`KIPITINY_DOMAIN` for [maintenance pages](/docs/domains#maintenance-page). Deploys, builds, backups (streamed back
through SSH to any target), restore tests, logs and the reconciler all work the
same on every server. The injected health probe is copied to each server once
(it needs the same CPU architecture as the manager; otherwise replicas are
gated on staying up instead).
