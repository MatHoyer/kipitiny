# kipitiny

Lightweight self-hosted PaaS: Docker apps + PostgreSQL with clean, verified backups.
Single Go binary with an embedded React UI, SQLite for state, Traefik for routing.

See [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for the full design.

## Run

```sh
docker compose up -d --build   # http://localhost:3000
```

The manager controls the host Docker daemon through the mounted socket.
**Access to the socket is root on the host**, so the UI and API require a login.

On first start the manager logs a one-time **setup token**
(`docker compose logs manager | grep setup_token`); the UI asks for it to create
the admin account. Forgot the password?

```sh
docker compose exec -it manager /kipitiny reset-password admin
```

## Services

- **Apps** run from an image, optionally public on a domain (HTTPS via Traefik), 1–10 replicas.
- **PostgreSQL** services get generated credentials, a named data volume, a memory
  limit with matching `shared_buffers`, and a `pg_isready` healthcheck. They are
  only reachable inside their project, at `<service-name>:5432`. Link an app to a
  database and it receives `DATABASE_URL` (an explicit `DATABASE_URL` env var wins).
- Deleting a database or a project destroys data and must be confirmed by typing its name.

## Backups

- `pg_dump -Fc` runs **inside** the database container (client always matches the
  server) and streams straight to the target: local disk (`/data/backups`) or any
  S3-compatible bucket. Memory stays constant; nothing touches a temp file.
- A backup only counts once `pg_dump` exits 0; partial uploads are deleted. Each
  backup records size, SHA-256, server version and duration.
- Restores load the dump into a scratch database and swap it in by rename, so the
  result is exactly the backup and a failed restore leaves live data untouched.
  Apps linked to the database are stopped meanwhile. The checksum is verified.
- Backups outlive their database and project; delete them explicitly.

S3 targets are checked (a test object is written and deleted) before they are saved.
`go test ./internal/storage/` runs S3 tests against a real server when
`KIPITINY_TEST_S3_ENDPOINT` is set (see `internal/storage/s3_test.go`).

## Develop

Requires Go 1.26+, Node 24+, pnpm 10.

```sh
make dev-api   # Go API on :8080 (data in ./data)
make dev-ui    # Vite on :5173, proxies /api to :8080
make test      # go test ./...
make lint      # go vet + tsc
make build     # UI + static binary in bin/
make docker    # image `kipitiny`
```

## Configuration

| Env var              | Default | |
|----------------------|---------|---|
| `KIPITINY_ADDR`      | `:3000` | HTTP listen address |
| `KIPITINY_DATA_DIR`  | `/data` | SQLite DB, deploy logs, local backups. Local disk only. |
| `KIPITINY_LOG_LEVEL` | `info`  | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `KIPITINY_SETUP_TOKEN` | random | Fix the first-run setup token instead of generating one |
| `KIPITINY_TRAEFIK`   | `true`  | Run and maintain the Traefik container (`false` to bring your own) |
| `KIPITINY_TRAEFIK_IMAGE` | `traefik:v3.7` | |
| `KIPITINY_HTTP_PORT` / `KIPITINY_HTTPS_PORT` | `80` / `443` | Host ports Traefik binds |
| `KIPITINY_ACME_EMAIL` | — | Let's Encrypt account email (optional) |
| `KIPITINY_DOCKER_SOCKET` | `/var/run/docker.sock` | Host socket path mounted into Traefik |
| `DOCKER_HOST`        | socket  | Standard Docker client env vars apply |

Traefik is (re)created on startup whenever its configuration changes; it keeps
running across manager restarts. HTTP redirects to HTTPS, certificates come from
Let's Encrypt (TLS-ALPN challenge, so port 443 must be reachable publicly).

For local testing use a `*.localhost` domain and alternate ports, e.g.
`KIPITINY_HTTP_PORT=8081 KIPITINY_HTTPS_PORT=8443`, then
`curl -k https://app.localhost:8443` (Traefik serves its default self-signed cert).

## Layout

```
cmd/kipitiny/          entrypoint
internal/config/       env config
internal/core/         service layer (REST + future MCP call this)
internal/api/          JSON HTTP handlers
internal/docker/       Docker client wrapper, label/network conventions
internal/store/        Store interface + models
internal/store/sqlite/ SQLite impl (bun + goose migrations)
web/                   React SPA (Vite), embedded via go:embed
```
